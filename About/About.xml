Update of Wzrds mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1560006592

NOTICE: Carrying Capacity is capped by the stack limit so without any other mods this only works on pawns with less than 75 carrying capacity due to injuries. You will need to choose a mod for yourself for that aspect.
